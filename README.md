Weather Bot For Telegram Using Python
This Bot i written by me, firct-year student. I was very fascinated by options which Python gives, so as my University 1-semester project i decided to make a Weather-Bot for Telegram. It is written , using libraries: "requests", "telebot". For getting data is used API from OpenWeatherMap.com, to upload Bot to Telegram I used @BotFather.
The Bot uses stickers from Telegram and shows accurate data and advices in Polish language(that's because i study in Poland).
The bot in telegram has funny username "Czumba"( tranliteration from russian translation of some dialogs from "Cyberpunk" ;-) ).
You can find it in Telegram by tagging @Weather_sprinter_bot.
Well I don't have my own server so the bot works only when my PC is turned on.
To write it i used some manual for pyTelegramBotApi, and requests libraries. I also used some github repositories, because I am just a starter and needed some help.
To run bot just move to your loaction of it's code in cmd and tyoe python weathbot.by, and now you can use it wherever you want(samrtphone, pc, etc).
ALLERT: the bot won't run correctly, if you do not place those stickers in it's folder!
Have a nice day.
